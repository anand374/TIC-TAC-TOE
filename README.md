# TIC-TAC-TOE
This is a hobby project made in my Winter Vacations.
Basically, I made a terminal TIC TAC TOE, which is played by a single player with the Computer.

I have created the comp player such that it plays intelligently, by checking for possible winning moves in the next turn.

Do try it out!
